# HEB-Vendor-Management-
Project proposal for a new vendor management system for the Texas retail giant HEB.
H-E-B is a private American chain of supermarkets from San Antonio, Texas. They own a total of 350 stores in the state of Texas in the U.S. as well as Northeast Mexico. It ranks 20th in the largest retailers in the United States. 

This project is for H-E-B as a part of its expansion plan. H-E-B has been doing great with its 350 stores. However, they still have not covered the entire state of Texas. They plan on expanding to the East part of Texas, with first expanded branch opening up in Tyler, Texas. Expansion brings in the need of upgrading the current systems in terms of UI and storage and processing capacity. 

H-E-B wants to partner with local vendors, manufacturers and farmers in order to be able to sell the local products as that has always been one of its special points of H-E-B.  The purpose of this project is to create a vendor management system for HEB and help them expand to various parts of Texas and other states by identifying and understanding the various market regions demands and catering to an improved vendor management system. 

This goes hand in hand with an upgraded inventory management system and will help in ease of communication with vendors, warehouses and help in predict the various trends in terms of what will/will not sell and what will be the future demand. We also plan to design a Quality Management system to test the quality of incoming products, decide on the expiry dates of the products and sell the only best to the customers

The above comprehensive project proposal contains the following: 
a)A comprehensive stakeholder analysis with focus on top 5 most impacted stakeholders.
b)A comprehensive needs analysis with focus on the top 5 stakeholders.
c)UML diagrams, Class diagrams, and ER diagrams and user stories on Customers, Manufactures, vendors, HEB etc.
d)Mockups and wireframes of potential of HEB sites for vendors/customers.
e)A project plan including implementation strategy and Gantt chart showing tentative completion of various milestones of SDLC and feature rollouts.
f)Comprehensive training plan for HEB employees, documentation for HEB and strategy for long term support service for HEB.

#Project Learning includes
Designing a distributed system to meet business needs and use Unified Modeling Language
(UML) to document it.
● Clearly communicate with stakeholders through effective presentations and create a
comprehensive project specification.
● Understanding and describing processes to gather requirements, analyze
processes and data, design architecture and user interfaces, and implement information
systems.
● Understand and apply Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD).
● Create and use a project plan with timelines and assigned resources.
● Compare and contrast alternative design and development methodologies, including
classical waterfall, agile development, extreme programming, RUP, etc.
● Understand the different modes of QA and testing, and put together a test plan to ensure
the system meets the needs identified during analysis activities.
